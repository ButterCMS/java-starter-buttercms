Please include a completed version of this checklist in the PR comments
    when turning in projects.

Note: For frameworks that generate static sites, e.g., NextJS, etc.: once these
    sites have been built, both locally and in production, they will not
    automatically reflect changes to content in the customer's ButterCMS.com
    account without rebuilding. As such, items that refer to updating items
    with changes, such as posts, pages, header, catgories, tags, etc.,
    assume this is being tested while running the hot-reloading development server.

## Local Configuration and Token
- [ ] Readme is placed in repo and uses language from the sample readme from
    the front-end asset respository.

    variables, including Butter token (generally by storing in an .env file).
- [ ] If value for Butter token is present in .env file but set to an invalid
    value, navigating to any page in the local version displays a 404 page.

- [ ] For frameworks like Django that generate dynamic sites, edits to blog posts in the
    customer's ButterCMS.com account are reflected in the deployed hosted site.
- [ ] Once deployed with a hosting provider, clicking on "preview" in the customer's
    ButterCMS.com account for a page or post shows a preview of the changes in the
    ButterCMS.com iframe panel (requires entering URL of hosted site into ButterCMS.com
    when prompted.)
- [ ] For frameworks that generate static sites, webhooks that trigger
    rebuilds-on-content-changes need to be automatically created in the ButterCMS platform
    for the user. For example, for Vercel, we created
    https://buttercms.com/onboarding/vercel-starter-deploy-callback/; which does this
    by tapping into the Vercel deploy button flow. For non-Vercel hosting, work with
    ButterCMS team on supporting a similar flow.
