# Java Spring Boot +  ButterCMS Starter Project

This Java + Spring Boot starter project fully integrates with dynamic sample 
content from your ButterCMS account, including main menu, pages, blog posts, 
categories, and tags, all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented 
search functionality. All of the included sample content is automatically created 
in your account dashboard when you sign up for a free trial of ButterCMS.
